Thing about how you can cache data
    Try using local storage
Periodic sync with the server - Just like To Do
    Update/Validate data
    Upload data to server
Add Table schema (for local storage)
    How many tables you are going to have
    What all data stored in each table

    For example:
    1 table for user data
    1 table for phone numbers data
Decide cloud storage
    E.g. Use AWS DynamoDB for storing user data
Caching?
    When to use?
